# Matrix Library V.1.

## Description


This library is in the midst of becoming a beginner level V.1. of a matrix library which includes some operations. 
As a freshman, planning on expanding my knowledge in c++, to make this library more unique, and easier to work with. 

## To Do
- [x] Scalar Multiplication
- [x] Matrix Multiplication - Almost
- [x] Matrix Addition/Subtraction
- [x] Matrix Size Flexibility
- [x] Transpose
- [x] Inverse of 2x2 ONLY
- [x] REF
- [x] Rank
- [ ] LU Factorization
- [x] Fix in the edge cases! (Pt.1) ```(Finish End of this week)```
- [x] Create better algorithms for the code / optimize ```(Finish End of this week)```
- [x] Better documentation 
- [x] Handle errors ```(During this process)```
- [ ] Test out Valgrind ```(maybe?)```
- [ ] Scary part -> Feedback

## Future To Do's (Possibly V.2.?)
- [ ] Any other things taught in class
