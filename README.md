# Matrix Library V.1.

## Description


This library is in the midst of becoming a beginner level V.1. of a matrix library which includes some operations. 
As a freshman, planning on expanding my knowledge in c++, to make this library more unique, and easier to work with. 

## To Do
- [x] Scalar Multiplication
- [x] Matrix Multiplication - Almost
- [x] Matrix Addition/Subtraction
- [x] Matrix Size Flexibility
- [x] Transpose
- [x] Inverse of 2x2 ONLY
- [x] REF
- [ ] Fix in the edge cases! (Pt.1) ```(Finish End of this week)```
- [ ] Create better algorithms for the code / optimize ```(Finish End of this week)```
- [ ] Input the GoogleTests along w/ learning about workflows (YAML) ```(Finish next two weeks with Professor - Google Tests around the 28th if not earlier)```
- [ ] Better documentation 
- [ ] Handle errors ```(During this process)```
- [ ] Scary part -> Feedback

## Future To Do's (Possibly V.2.?)
- [ ] Identity Multiplication
- [ ] RREF/REF
- [ ] Any other things taught in class
