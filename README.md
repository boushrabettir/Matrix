# Matrix Library

## Description

This is just to practice what I've learned in OOP so far and Linear Algebra
The making of this simple library was to gain a better understanding of matrices as well as building a simple project along the way.

P.S. I kind of get bored and make small things like this for fun and to learn, I guess.
